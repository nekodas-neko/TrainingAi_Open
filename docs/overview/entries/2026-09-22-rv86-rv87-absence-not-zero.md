# 2026-09-22 — RV-86 + RV-87: a failed read is not a measured zero

**Branch:** `fix/rv86-rv87-absence-not-zero` · **Lane:** Implementation B · **Version:** 1.464.2

## What shipped

Two screens rendered a failed fetch as a confident number.

- **RV-86 — Home's Streak card.** `/api/streak-data` failing left `calendarDays` at its `{}` initial
  value, and the card painted that as fact. It now takes a `loaded` prop, raised only by the cache
  seed and by `onData`, and the streak figure, the week count, the week progress bar and the ten-day
  dot strip all render an unknown state until it is true.
- **RV-87 — the Profile tab.** Every lifetime figure was a `?? 0` default handed straight to
  `StatsGrid` and `AchievementsSection`. A failed `/api/achievements` read as a genuine
  *Level 1 · Novice · 0 XP* with an all-zero lifetime, **best streak included**. `StatsGrid` and
  `AchievementsSection` now take a gate prop, the hero reads `Level —`, and one
  "Couldn't load your stats — pull to refresh." line appears.

## Two of the entries' claims did not survive contact

- **RV-86 said the streak number itself had "no unknown representation".** It already did —
  `streak-card.tsx:82` rendered `streak > 0 ? streak : "—"` before this change. The confident zeros
  were the *week* count ("0 / 5 · sessions done", with an empty progress bar) and the ten-day dot
  strip, which the entry does not mention. The fix went where the defect was.
- **RV-86 also implicated the rest-day banner** ("Resting today breaks your streak"). It is driven
  by `recommendation?.consecutiveRestDays`, from `/api/next-session` — a different fetch, guarded by
  `consecutiveRestDays != null && >= 1`, so a failed streak read cannot produce it. Not touched.
- **RV-87's "the grid below spins forever (RV-84)"** was already fixed, in #1391 the day before:
  `achievements-section.tsx` renders "Could not load achievements" on a null payload. Only the
  header's `0 / 0` and the figures above it were left.
- **RV-86's open question — can `pendingDays` independently populate a nonzero streak offline?** Yes,
  the outbox overlay merges into `trainedDays` regardless of the fetch. It is deliberately *not*
  treated as raising the gate: one unsynced workout does not make a 365-day history known, so the
  card still reads "—" and the pending day still lights its dot.

## The size ratchet forced an extraction, which is what it is for

`session-select-content.tsx` sits on a 1448-line baseline that may not grow, and the change added 11
lines. Rather than shave comments, the streak walk moved to `app/session-select/compute-streak.ts`
(1459 → 1431). The move is mechanical and `computeStreak` now has its own test pinning the rest-gap
rule — two rest days are bridged and credited, the third breaks the walk — which nothing asserted
while it was inline.

The move turned `lib/__tests__/rv57-streak-lookback-contract.test.ts` red, which is the right
behaviour and was left as-is rather than loosened: RV-57 asserts the consumer of
`STREAK_LOOKBACK_DAYS` imports it instead of walking to a literal, and naming a path is how that
test notices the consumer has gone somewhere it is no longer watching. It was repointed, not
relaxed.

## Verification

- `pnpm check:rules` — **Ran 75 of 75**, all passed (it was the component-size step that failed
  before the extraction).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean; lint clean on the changed files (the warnings it prints are pre-existing).
- **e2e, `rv86-rv87-absence-is-not-zero.spec.ts`** — intercepts each endpoint with a 500 and asserts
  the rendered text, at the 412 px S25 viewport. **Both specs were run against the unfixed components
  as a control**, not just against the fix.
- Two unit files, both mutation-checked rather than merely green: raising the gate inside a `.catch`
  handler, and making a gate prop optional, each turn the source-shape test red.

**Not exercised:** no device sitting. These are render-only changes in no device-gated class
(no offline-first write path, native plugin, safe area, gesture or notification), and the e2e run is
the web build, where `getLocalStore` returns null — so the `pendingDays` overlay interaction with the
new gate is reasoned about above, not observed on the device path.
