# RV-64 — the HR profile is read by the screens, not by the chart that remounts

**Branch:** `perf/rv64-hr-profile-remount` · **Lane B** · no version bump (see below)

## What shipped

`LiveHrChart` read `hr-profile` in a mount-once effect, and `active-workout-screen.tsx` renders it
on `workoutPhase === "rest"`. So it remounted **once per rest period**: a 5×4 workout paid a
~230 ms route around twenty times *during the workout*, against the same ten-connection pool as
`log-exercise` and `complete-workout` — and `/api/hr-profile`'s 20-per-60s limit meant a dense rest
cadence could make the chart 429 itself.

The chart now takes `profile` as a prop. The two screens that render it and outlive it —
`active-workout-screen` and `exercise-summary-screen` — own the read through a new
`lib/hooks/use-hr-profile.ts`, which wraps `useCachedValue` and owns the key, URL and TTL for the
workout flow. The active screen stays mounted for the whole active phase, so its ~20 reads become
one.

## The entry offered two fixes and one of them is wrong

RV-64 also proposed `freshWithinTtl: true`, and said the written invalidation proof that flag
requires was *"available rather than owed"* because `HR_PROFILE_TTL` is 6 h and two groups in
`lib/cache-groups.ts` already clear `hr-profile`.

**The proof does not hold.** The flag needs *every writer of the payload* to sit in a group that
clears the key, not two of them. `resolveHrProfile` computes from `repo.getUserById`,
`repo.listBodyMetrics` and `repo.getHrForWindow` over **90 days** — and live BLE samples land inside
that window *during the workout*, ingested natively and server-side, with nothing in
`lib/live-hr/**` invalidating anything. The two groups are `invalidateOuraSync` and
`invalidateBodyMetricWrite`; neither fires for live ingest. So the flag would have pinned a profile
for up to six hours **across workouts**, where hoisting bounds the staleness to one screen's
lifetime. Checking which groups contain the key is not the same check as which writers change the
payload.

## What the test can and cannot see

`lib/hooks/__tests__/rv64-hr-profile-read-is-hoisted.test.ts` is **structural**, and deliberately so
rather than as a shortcut: the repo has no React render harness, and
`use-invalidation-refetch.test.ts` is the established shape for "which module is allowed to do
this". No spec drives the active workout through a rest period, so counting real requests would
have meant building that fixture first.

**Mutation-checked three ways**, one per claim: putting the fetch back in the chart fails it;
calling the hook but dropping the prop at the call site fails it; adding a third mount site — which
compiles and renders and would silently draw no zones, since the prop has no default — fails it.

One assertion was wrong on the first draft and the test caught it rather than the code: matching
`/hr-profile/` failed on the chart's legitimate `import type { HrProfileResponse } from
'@/app/api/hr-profile/route'`. A second matched this file's own comment naming `useHrProfile`.
Assertions now match the URL, and read source with comments stripped — a test that cannot tell prose
from a call punishes documenting the change.

**What it cannot see: the request count on a running app.** "One call per workout instead of ~20"
follows from the chart not fetching plus the owner outliving it, and the second half is read off the
source rather than observed.

## A stale annotation, corrected

`live-hr-chart` was in `check-fetch-once-effects.js`'s frozen list annotated *"inside
exercise-summary-screen"* — only half its mounts, and the wrong half. `active-workout-screen`
renders it on the rest phase, which is the whole of RV-64's cost. The list's judgement ("nothing
writes those keys during that window") was about **staleness** and was right; the cost was never the
question that list asks. Its row is removed, because the check itself fails and says to remove it
when a site goes, and the note now says to judge a site by *every* place it mounts.

## Not exercised

**No device pass**, and the entry keeps one. The measured claim is a request count, and this was
verified structurally plus by four e2e runs of the workout screens.

`bf163-intensity-chip-load-only` failed once on the branch and then passed four times — alone and in
the same two-spec pairing, on the branch and on clean `main`. It is in the same flaky set CI
reported on #1377. **Recorded as unexplained rather than closed:** it was not reproduced, and one
red that will not come back is not the same as one understood.

## No version bump

Nothing user-visible changed. The chart draws the same zones from the same profile; what changed is
how many times the app asks for it.
